    Provides,
    Singleton,
    Inject,
    KojectStart,
    LazyInject,
} from '@site/src/components/CodeLink';

# Start Koject
To start using Koject, simply add the <Provides/> annotation to the classes you want to make available for injection.

```kotlin
@Provides
class Repository

@Provides
class Controller(
    private val repository: Repository
)
```

Koject uses the [primary constructor](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors) to instantiate objects, so it's important to make sure that all parameter types in the primary constructor are annotated with `@Provides`.

Once you have called <KojectStart/>, you can obtain an instance of a class by using the <Inject/> method.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    Koject.start()

    val controller = inject<Controller>()
}
```

In this case, `inject<Controller>()` will return an instance of the `Controller` class that has been instantiated by Koject using its primary constructor and `@Provides` annotated dependencies. 

## Provide from functions
The `@Provides` annotation can also be used in top-level functions and can provide any types.
This is especially useful when providing types outside the current module.

```kotlin
@Provides
fun provideDBConfig(): DBConfig {
    return DBConfig.Builder().build()
}

@Provides
fun provideDB(dbConfig: DBConfig): DB {
    return DB.create(dbConfig)
}
```

In addition to top-level functions, it is also possible to provide types by functions of objects or companion objects.

By using objects, you can group provide functions.

```kotlin
object DBFactory {
    @Provides
    fun provideConfig(): DBConfig {
        return DBConfig.Builder().build()
    }

    @Provides
    fun provide(dbConfig: DBConfig): DB {
        return DB.create(dbConfig)
    }
}
```

By using companion objects, the relationship with a specific type becomes more clear.

```kotlin
class DB {
    companion object {
        @Provides
        fun create(): DB {
            return DB()
        }
    }
}
```

## Singleton Scope
You can use the <Singleton/> annotation to create an instance only once and reuse it throughout the application.
This can be used for dependencies that are expensive to create or dependencies that need to be shared among multiple classes.

```kotlin
@Singleton
@Provides
class Api

@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideDB(): DB {
    return DB.create()
}

@Singleton
@Provids
class Repository(
    private val api: Api,
    private val db: DB,
)
```

In this case, all three classes (`Api`, `DB`, and `Repository`) are annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that Koject will create only one instance of each and reuse them throughout the application.

## Lazy Injection
By using <LazyInject/> instead of `inject()`, you can get `Lazy` instance and enable lazy injection.

```kotlin
class UIController {
    val service: SomeController by lazyInject()

    override fun onCreate() {
        service.doSomething() // lazy injection
    }
}
```
