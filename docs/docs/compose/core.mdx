# Inject into Composable
Koject can inject into Composable.

## Setup for Compose
To inject into Composable, add the following dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.moriatsushi.koject:koject-compose-core:1.1.0-beta02")
}
```

Please also check the [Setup document](/docs/setup).

## Use with Compose
You can inject a provided type into a Composable using the <a href="/api/compose/core/com.moriatsushi.koject.compose/remember-inject.html" target="_blank">`rememberInject()`</a> Composable function.

```kotlin
@Provides
class SampleController
```
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = rememberInject()
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

:::caution

Do not call the `inject()` function directly inside a Composable function.
Creating an instance for each render or running the injection process many times can cause performance degradation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = inject() // DO NOT!!
) {
    /* ... */
}
```
