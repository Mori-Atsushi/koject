# Inject into Composable
Koject allows injection into Composable functions.

## Setup for Compose
To use Koject for injection into Composable functions, you need to add the following dependencies to your project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.moriatsushi.koject:koject-compose-core:1.1.0")
}
```

Please also refer to the [Setup document](/docs/setup).

## Using Koject with Compose
To inject a provided type into a Composable function, you can use the <RememberInject/> Composable function.

```kotlin
@Provides
class SampleController
```
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = rememberInject()
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

:::tip
While you can call `rememberInject()` inside Composable functions, it is recommended to use it as a default argument instead.
This makes it easier to replace the injected dependency during testing.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample() {
    val controller: SampleController = rememberInject() // Not recommended
}
```
:::

:::caution

Do not call the <Inject/> function directly from Composable functions.
Creating a new instance for each render or running the injection process many times can cause performance degradation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = inject() // DO NOT!!
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

## Inject Compsable CoroutineScope
Koject defines the <ComposeComponent/>, which restricts a type to be injectable only into Composable functions or `ComposeComponent` types.

```kotlin
@ComposeComponent
class ComposeHelper
```
```kotlin
@ComposeComponent
class ComposeHelperHolder(
    val helper: ComposeHelper // can be injected
)
```
```kotlin
val MyActivity: ComponentActivity {
    val helper: ComposeHelper by lazyInject() // can be injected
}
```

The `ComposeComponent` type can also inject an comopsition-scoped `CoroutineScope`.
The `CoroutineScope` requires an <ComposeCoroutineScope/> qualifier.

```kotlin
@ComposeComponent
class ComposeHelper(
    @ComposeCoroutineScope
    val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope // same as rememberCoroutineScope()
)
```

This `CoroutineScope` will be canceled when hidden, just like `rememberCoroutineScope()`.

## Inject Context (Android)
Similarly, `android.content.Context` can be injected by adding a <ComposeContext/> qualifier in Android.

```kotlin
@ComposeContext
class ComposeHelper(
    @ComposeContext
    val context: Context // same as LocalContext.current
)
```
