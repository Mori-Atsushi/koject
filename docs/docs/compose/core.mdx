# Inject into Composable
Koject can inject into Composable.

## Setup for Compose
To inject into Composable, add the following dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.moriatsushi.koject:koject-compose-core:1.1.0")
}
```

Please also check the [Setup document](/docs/setup).

## Use with Compose
You can inject a provided type into a Composable using the <RememberInject/> Composable function.

```kotlin
@Provides
class SampleController
```
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = rememberInject()
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

:::tip
`rememberInject()` can be called inside Composable functions, but it is recommended to use it as a default argument. This will make it easier to replace during testing.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample() {
    val controller: SampleController = rememberInject() // Not recommended
}
```
:::

:::caution

Do not call the <Inject/> function directly from Composable functions.
Creating an instance for each render or running the injection process many times can cause performance degradation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = inject() // DO NOT!!
) {
    /* ... */
}
```
