# Koject v1.1.0 - Enhanced Android support

![](/blog/2023-03-11/banner.png)

I have released **Koject v1.1.0**, which includes enhanced support for Android application development.
In this article, I will introduce the new features and the Component feature that enables the features.

## Inject ViewModels
In Android application development, it is common to add dependencies such as Repository to AndroidX's [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) and use it from Activity or Fragment. With Koject v1.1.0, you can automatically inject ViewModel dependencies.

First, add the <a href="/api/core/com.moriatsushi.koject/-provides/index.html" target="_blank">`@Provides`</a> annotation to the class used in ViewModel and register it with the DI container. By adding <a href="/api/core/com.moriatsushi.koject/-singleton/index.html" target="_blank">`@Singleton`</a>, it can register as a singleton.

```kotlin
@Singleton
@Provides
class UserRepository {
    /* ... */
}

@Singleton
@Provides
class ContentRepository {
    /* ... */
}
```

Next, define the ViewModel. You can inject the classes registered with the DI container in the constructor. Add `@Provides` annotation and <a href="/api/android/viewmodel/com.moriatsushi.koject.android.viewmodel/-view-model-component/index.html" target="_blank">`@ViewModelComponent`</a> annotation to ViewModel.

```kotlin
@Provides
@ViewModelComponent
class TopViewModel(
    private val userRepository: UserRepository,
    private val contentRepository: ContentRepository,
): ViewModel() {
    /* ... */
}
```

Finally, use the <a href="/api/android/activity/com.moriatsushi.koject.android.activity/inject-view-models.html" target="_blank">`ComponentActivity.injectViewModels()`</a> function to obtain the ViewModel.

```kotlin
class TopActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    private val viewModel: TopViewModel by injectViewModels()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

For Fragment, please use the <a href="/api/android/fragment/com.moriatsushi.koject.android.fragment/inject-view-models.html" target="_blank">`Fragment.injectViewModels()`</a> function instead.

```kotlin
class TopFragment : Fragment() {
    private val viewModel: TopViewModel by injectViewModels()

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?,
    ): View? {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Additional dependencies are required to use this feature. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/android/viewmodel).

## Inject into Composable
Koject 1.1.0 also added support for [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/).

You can use the <a href="/api/compose/core/com.moriatsushi.koject.compose/remember-inject.html" target="_blank">`rememberInject()`</a> Composable function to use the provided class in a Composable function.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = rememberInject()
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

`rememberInject()` can be called inside Composable functions, but it is recommended to **use it as a default argument**.
This will make it easier to replace during testing.

Please **do not to use the <a href="/api/core/com.moriatsushi.koject/inject.html" target="_blank">`inject()`</a> function inside Composable functions**. Creating an instance for each rendering or performing inject processing multiple times may cause performance degradation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Sample(
    controller: SampleController = inject() // DO NOT!!
) {
    /* ... */
}
```

For the setup method, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/compose/core).

## Component feature
In ViewModel, you can inject a [`SavedStateHandle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/SavedStateHandle) to save the state:

```kotlin
@Provides
@ViewModelComponent
class SavedStateViewModel(
    private val savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle
) : ViewModel() {
    /* ... */
}
```

Koject has added the **Component feature** to provide instances created by the platform, such as `SavedStateHandle`.

A Component is a grouping of types registered with the DI container.
By default, the all types are registered in the root component.
By annotating with a Component annotation, they can be registered in another component.

```kotlin
// Registered in RootComponent
@Provides
class NormalClass

// Registered in SomeComponent
@SomeComponent
@Provides
class ComponentClass
```

Types registered in a component can only reference types within the same component and types in the root component.

You can also provide additional dependencies to a component.

Koject defines `@ViewModelComponent` by default and adds `SavedStateHandle` to `@ViewModelComponent`.
Therefore, be aware that you cannot inject `SavedStateHandle` into a component other than `@ViewModelComponent`.

You can learn how to create a custom component in the [documentation](/docs/core/component).

:::caution Experimental

The Component feature is an **experimental** API. It may change in the future.

## Koject is evolving
I believe that Koject v1.1.0 will provide even stronger support for Android application development.
In order to make the library even easier to use, I plan to add even more features in the future.
